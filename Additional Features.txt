~~ Possible Features to Add ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	1~ Choose Different Fusion Techniques:
	--------------------------------------

	1. Simple Pixel-based Methods (Spatial Domain): These work directly on pixels.

	.Averaging (what you already have)
	.Maximum selection (Lighten) → choose the brightest pixel
	.Minimum selection (Darken) → choose the darkest pixel
	.Weighted Average → like your fusion strength slider (a mix between two images)
	.Alpha Blending → a fancy word for smooth mixing between images
	.Simple Add/Subtract → adding/subtracting pixel values

	These methods are super fast and easy to code.

	2. Transform-based Methods (Frequency Domain): These first transform the images into something else (like 	waves or frequencies), then fuse.

	.Wavelet Transform Fusion
	.Fourier Transform Fusion
	.Pyramid Fusion (Laplacian or Gaussian Pyramids)

	These methods are very powerful for professional projects (like medical imaging, satellite pictures), but 	a bit heavier to program.

	 3. Learning-based Methods (Deep Learning): New, very advanced methods using AI.

	.CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) Fusion
	.GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) for Fusion
	.Transformer-based Fusion (like modern AI models)

	Very strong for complex tasks, but require training models and a lot of coding knowledge.

	2~ Show Quality Metrics:
	------------------------

	After fusion, automatically compute and show:
		.PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)
		.SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)
	These are used to compare quality between fusion results.

	Makes the app scientific and useful for analysis.

	3~ Execution Time Measurement:
	------------------------------

	.Use console.time() and console.timeEnd() to measure how long the fusion operation took.
	.Display execution time on the page.

	Important if you want to compare "which method is faster."

	4~ Fusion Strength Slider:
	--------------------------

	.Add a slider (input range) to control the fusion ratio; For example: 70% Image 1 + 30% Image 2
	.You can adjust ctx.globalAlpha dynamically.

	This gives users control over the blending strength.

	5~ Drag and Drop Upload:
	------------------------

	.Allow users to drag images directly into the page instead of clicking “Choose File”.

	Looks more modern and user-friendly.

	6~ Show Side-by-Side Comparisons:
	---------------------------------

	.Before fusion, show the two input images side-by-side.
	.After fusion, show the fused image.

	Helps users visually understand the fusion effect better.

	7~  Mobile Responsive Design:
	-----------------------------

	.Make the page adapt to mobile devices.
	.Use flexbox/grid and set responsive canvas size.

	Helps if you want your project to be demoed on tablets/phones too.

	8~ Deep Learning Fusion:
	------------------------

	.Use OpenCV.js to run small pre-trained models in the browser.
	.For example: fuse infrared and visible images using a light CNN model.

	More advanced, but optional if you have time.
